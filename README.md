# spring-crm-rest

This is a CRM app made using Spring MVC, Hibernate and Spring REST.

This is similar to the CRM web app I made before, but now we are using REST to get an idea how to use REST APIs.

During this project I learned more about:

* Spring REST
* JSON
* Data Binding/Jackson
* HTTP Requests
* HTTP Responses
* Exception Handling Bad Requests
* @ControllerAdvice, @PathVariable, @ExceptionHandler Annotations
